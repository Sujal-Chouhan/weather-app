**Getting Started**
Welcome to my weather app! This app provides the current weather conditions for a selected location. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, so you can easily access it from your browser by following the link below:

https://sujal-chouhan.github.io/weather-app/

The app will automatically show the current weather conditions for Toronto, Canada, but you can also search for the weather in a different location by entering a city name in the search bar. The app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, and you can choose to view the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out!
